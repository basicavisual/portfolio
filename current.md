Ni uno ni una más is an NGO from Mexico City, México, who works with data and victims of Mexico's dissapeared. They needed a blog engine to give their online presence a newer image. I worked with them to develop a new branding, UX and UI for their new site, and chose wordpress as the blogging engine, as it needed to be easily mantained in the long term. I am developing a new wordpress theme for them.


### [3 de 3 datos, Transparencia Mexicana, Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/ponentesincausa/3de3datos/)
![3de3](https://github.com/ponentesincausa/portfolio/blob/master/imgs/3de3.png?raw=true)

3de3 Datos is the continuation of the project 3de3 by Transparencia Mexicana and IMCO that they work with the Mexico City Government. This is a Rails app that consumes data from an external server and processes for display. For this project I wrote a search engine and had to build models that could interact with each other in the views.
