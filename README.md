# Portfolio

Here are some of my projects

### Layout design

[Ni uno ni una m√°s](ponentesincausa.github.io/n1n1a) is a NGO who wanted to take their website to the next level. They are currently using a blogspot platform. I am recreating their site and desing the layout above. I am in the process of turning this into its own [wordpress template](https://github.com/ponentesincausa/niunoniunamas).

[3de3 datos](https://ponentesincausa.github.io/landing3de3/index3.html) will be the new platform of 3de3 for Transparencia Mexicana & the government of Mexico City. I am coding it in rails.

[Parvada](parvada.github.io) is an NGO that works with poor women bringing them practical civic education so that they can navigate institutions to demand their rights. This is the layout for the site (some adjustments, including responsive, are still pending).


### Other

[Idea roulette](idea-roulette.herokuapp.com) is a decisions combinator. You can populate it with any options you want and lock combinations. I developed it for Distrito Emprendedor. It doesn't have responsive as it was not required by them.


#### D3.js visualizations
