Parvada is an NGO at Guadalajara, Jalisco that works with women in irregular settlements. This was the first approach to their landing page from UX to Coding.

Ideador is a simple front-end app written in Javascript that generates combinations for any given text you choose. Like a roulette. I developed it for Distrito Emprendedor, who needed it for their ideation workshops. You can fork it from my github.
