Control Jets is a newly formed company that rents jets. I picked the requirements and iteratively built the website through a series of feedback rounds. It is built as an MVP to start operating asap, and measure user interactions with it.

Parvada is an NGO at Guadalajara, Jalisco that works with women in irregular settlements. This was the first approach to their landing page from UX to Coding. This is a HTML/CSS mockup.

Ideador is a simple front-end app written in Javascript that generates combinations for any given text you choose. Like a roulette. I developed it for Distrito Emprendedor, who needed it for their ideation workshops. You can fork it from my github.
